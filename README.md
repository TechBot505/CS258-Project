# Image-pair broswer and visualiser
This is an application that visualizes image pairs from multiple folders. The image pairs we refer to are two images with the same name but in different folders. Thee application allows users to select multiple folders, and it displays all the image pairs within those folders. To ensure the application's versatility, there is the option to add more than two folders.
### Purpose
The purpose of this software is to open images from multiple folders and visualise them. The images are of the same name and exist in different folders, maybe due to a series of image processing like segmentation, landmark or object detection, or upscaling. This tool would allow the user to visualise such images. 
### Project Scope
The system will consist of a software application that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The application will be responsible for processing directories and images.

# Tech-Stacks
1.   ### Electron
     - Electron is a popular framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
     - Basically a framework that provides the runtime environment for the application.
     - Electron's versatility, flexibility, and ease of use make it a popular choice for developers seeking to create robust, cross-platform desktop applications.
2.   ### React.js
     - ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces
     -  ReactJS has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools that make it easy to build complex applications, such as Redux for state management and React Router for routing.
3.   ### Tailwind-CSS
     - Tailwind CSS is a popular utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to rapidly build responsive and customizable user interfaces. 
     - Tailwind CSS is highly customizable, allowing developers to easily modify the default design system and create their own custom utility classes.
     - The framework is lightweight and optimized for performance, with a focus on reducing the size of the final CSS file.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
